- to run local: `yarn start`
- to build: `yarn build`
- to deploy: `yarn run deploy`

packages:

- [react-draggable](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-draggable/)
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)

to add (maybe):

- add links to post and page
- better viewer?
- progress pie
- maybe use https://ui.mantine.dev/ in the future for more nav stuff? but idk kinda like the simplicity

Imagine seeing light fractured into color. Shadows that vibrate purple and blue. The panes of a face simplified to a smudge. Today we look at those paintings and think, of course. I know that light-I’ve seen the way raindrops make the pavement shimmer into iridescent points, the chaotic blur of a field of wildflowers on a windy day. But I wonder if that imaginary viewer saw those paintings and walked away confused. That’s not how the world looks, they might have thought. There’s a disconnect. Their mind can’t find the bridge. For days, maybe weeks, they are searching, trying to understand. Until one day, they look up and see a sky like this and think, oh.",
